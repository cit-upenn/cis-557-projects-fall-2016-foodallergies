Food class:

/app/controller/foods_controller.rb
This is the food controller. Apart from the default methods generated by scaffold, I added a search method to obtain a specific food’s allergens and the overlap between user’s allergens and those of a food. The function specifically gets the current user’s allergens first and are stored in array named myAllergens. @foodAllergens is an array storing all the allergens of the food that user typed in the search bar. The food’s allergens are obtained by calling the food search API to obtain the list of ingredients that the food has. Then, the food’s allergens are obtained by getting each ingredient’s allergens. The mapping between ingredients and allergens are provided as text file by the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. @result is an array of the allergens overlapping the food’s allergens and the user’s allergens.

/app/view/foods/search.erb.html
This is the view page corresponding to the search function in the food controller, which displays a search bar where user can type the food of interest. The view is also responsible for displaying the food search result.

/app/models/food.rb
This is the model file for food class with association relation with ingredient and allergen classes. Validation for adding a food to the database is also added here. For example, the name of the food must be present and the first letter of the name must be capitalized.

Allergen class:

/app/controller/allergens_controller.rb
The controller is generated by scaffold.

/app/views/allergens
All the view files are generated by scaffold and wrapped with bootstrap.

/app/models/allergen.rb
This is the model file for allergen class with association relation with ingredient and food classes. Validation for adding an allergen to the database is also added here. The allergen must be unique so an existing allergen cannot be added to the allergen database. Also, the name of the allergen cannot be empty. The first letter of the name of the allergen must be capitalized.


Ingredient class:

/app/controller/ingredients_controller.rb
The controller is generated by scaffold.

/app/views/ingredients
All the view files are generated by scaffold and wrapped with bootstrap.

/app/models/ingredient.rb
This is the model file for ingredient class with association relation with allergen and food classes. Validation for adding an ingredient to the database is also added here. The ingredient must be unique so an existing allergen cannot be added to the ingredient database. Also, the name of the ingredient cannot be empty. The first letter of the name of the ingredient must be capitalized.
