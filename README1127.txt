In this iteration, the focus is on controller.
More specifically, I added a search function in the food controller to implement the search functionality.
At dashboard(homepage), user can click the link search food and will be directed to the search food page.
When a user inputs a food name of interest, if this food exists in the database, the page will show the allergens that this food contains.
In addition, if a user is allergic to certain allergens contained in this food, these allergens will be shown separately in red.
 If the user inputs a food name that does not match any existing entry, nothing will be shown.
